Mark/Replace Just-In-Time Metaprogramming Experiment

Quickstart::
----
cc -o test test.c
./test
----

This repository contains a library `mr.h`, which accepts C code with markers and allows you to replace the content between the markers programmatically.

For example, consider this C file:
[source, c]
----
static int numbers[] = {
// This is a marker named `test`.
//!mr { test
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
//!mr }
};
----

We'll now create a metaprogram that loads that file and generates another C file in-place of the previous one.
If we invoke this library method like that:
[source, c]
----
// `file` is an `mr_file` instance that contains the contents of the codeblock above
mr_replace_marker_contents(&file, "test", -1, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\n", -1);
----

The `file` instance will contain:
[source, c]
----
static int numbers[] = {
// This is a marker named `test`.
//!mr { test
    5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
//!mr }
};
----

== The Problem

Metaprograms in a language like C, which roughly maps to the generated machine code, running almost nothing at compile time, inherently complicate the build process of a project.

In applications, you can pretty easily integrate your metaprograms into the build system.
The same with static/dynamic libraries distributed in binary form.
However, if you want to bake something into a header-only library, this won't work, because these libraries _do not_ have a build system.

== The Solution

The idea is that the metaprogram is run by the programmer only when it is needed, and the generated code is committed into the repository.
This library allows easy substitution of specific code blocks with new code.
Theoretically, this could be integrated into a continuous integration system.

== The Problem Doesn't Actually Exist

Header-only libraries should be very simple, written in a commonly adopted standard, and easily distributable, usually as one source file.
Thus, any metaprogramming in such libraries should be avoided.

If the library is strictly tied to generated code, you should instead provide a header-only library generator (a good example of that is link:https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad[glad]).

Pros::
* Simpler build process -- no need to build & run metaprograms before building the target program

Cons::
* Not very good when baking big binary data -- leads to big repository
* Not automated -- stupid humans involved in the process

Despite the problem doesn't exist, I still publish this repository.
Maybe it will be useful for other tasks than the one it was designed to help with.
